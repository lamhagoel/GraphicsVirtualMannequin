These are the main design decisions for each part of the project:

Bone Picking:
We converted the NDC coordinates to world coordinates.
We calculate the rotation matrix and then we traverse all the bones to check any
cylinder intersection. For this we followed the code presented in Ray Tracer and we
adpated it to this project. Among all the intersection we took the minimum as the highlighted bone.

Bone Manipulation:


Linear-blend Skinning:
We implemented everything in Shaders.ts -> sceneVSText.
We took the qtrans() function given in skeletonVSText and placed in sceneVSText.
Then as the instruction suggested for each of the 4 joins we computed the deformed position of the
vertex.
