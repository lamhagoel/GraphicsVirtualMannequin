We allow edition to KeyFrames only on edition mode.

* Extra credit:
- Draw a timeline in the status bar area of the window:
We included a timeline next to the number of keyframes including ticks for keyframes.
- Find or create our own character model:
We found a character named alien animal and we included the different poses in the
following folder: src/skinning/character_model_poses/
This character can be activated by pressing the key "8".
- Creative Scene:
We used the wolf character model to create a video which is in the following link:

The video serves to show our work and also to generate conscience to the viewers.
We used Text-to-Speech conversion to generate the voice over.
